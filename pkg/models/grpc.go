package models

// Manual struct definitions for GrpcSpec, GrpcHeaders, GrpcLengthPrefixedMessage,
// GrpcReq, and GrpcResp have been removed from this file.
// These are now expected to be solely defined by the generated pkg/models/keploy.pb.go file
// from the pkg/models/keploy.proto definition.

// The GrpcStream struct and NewGrpcStream function were also removed as they were
// tightly coupled with the removed manual struct definitions. If this functionality
// is still required, it should be refactored to use the generated *.pb.go types.
