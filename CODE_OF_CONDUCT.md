# Contributor Code of Conduct for Keploy

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

 * Act authentically and participate actively in the community to help maintain a positive and productive environment.
 * Show consideration and respect in all your actions and speech. Avoid any behavior that is demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing.
 * Seek collaboration as an initial step instead of conflict.
 * Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
 * Report any unsafe situations, distress or violations of the code of conduct to the maintainers through [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/keploy/shared_invite/zt-357qqm9b5-PbZRVu3Yt2rJIa6ofrwWNg).
* Practice empathy and kindness towards other community members.
* Respect diverse opinions, perspectives, and experiences.
* Give and receive constructive feedback in a gracious manner.
* Take responsibility for your actions and apologize for mistakes. Use them as learning opportunities.
* Prioritize the well-being and success of the community as a whole over individual gain.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Violence, threats of violence or any language that incites violence towards any individual or group is prohibited.
 * Discriminatory jokes and language, such as those based on gender, race, sexual orientation, religion, ability, or any other characteristic, is strictly forbidden.
 * Displaying or sharing sexually explicit or violent content is prohibited.
 * Any form of harassment, including but not limited to "doxing" (posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information) is prohibited.
 * Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
* Publishing any personal information of others without their explicit consent is strictly forbidden.
* Using sexualized language or imagery, or making any sexual advances towards another person is prohibited.
* Harassment, whether it be public or private, will not be tolerated.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Organizations' maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces related to Keploy, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
support@keploy.io.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior,  harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.
