## Overview

I use Keploy internally to test features, validate fixes, and ensure backward
compatibility while developing and maintaining cloud-native applications.

## What I Test with Keploy

- API endpoints during feature development
- Integration flows between services
- Regression scenarios using recorded traffic

## Why I Use Keploy

Keploy allows me to quickly generate tests from real interactions, making it
easier to reproduce bugs and prevent regressions without writing extensive
manual test code.

## Where I Use Keploy

- Local development environments
- CI workflows for pull requests
- Internal testing before releases
