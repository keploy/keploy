## Introduction
In the organization I belong to, technical debt around testing has grown significantly during feature development.
This has resulted in high effort required for writing tests, inconsistent test granularity that leads to quality degradation, and CI pipelines that take around 30 minutes to complete.
These issues directly reduce our competitiveness as a service-oriented development team.
I believe Keploy is an excellent product that can help break out of this situation, and I am currently validating it in my personal development environment.
