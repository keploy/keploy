# Keploy

## Overview

Keploy is used internally to test and validate cloud-native applications using
integration testing, API testing, mocking, and automated test generation.

## What We Test with Keploy

- Backend APIs and services
- Microservices communicating over HTTP
- End-to-end application workflows

## Why We Use Keploy

Keploy helps us automatically generate test cases from real traffic and replay
them to catch regressions early. This significantly reduces the effort required
to write and maintain integration tests manually.

## Where We Use Keploy

- Local development
- CI/CD pipelines
- Production, Pre-production and staging environments

## Impact

- Reduced time spent writing integration tests
- Improved confidence in API changes
- Faster feedback during development and CI
