## Our Journey with Hacktoberfest ❤️

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) is an initiative that matters very deeply to us. We launched the first iteration of Keploy as a mere open-source project in December 2021. Hacktoberfest 2022 was truly a game-changer for us, as we saw over 200 contributions from some lovely members of the open-source community that October.

There are many different ways you can contribute to [Keploy](https://keploy.io). If you’ve ever wanted to contribute to open-source now is your chance!

All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to participate. [Learn How to Contribute?](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute)
