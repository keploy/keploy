## Our Journey with Hacktoberfest ❤️

🎉 What is Hacktoberfest?
Hacktoberfest is a global event that encourages people to contribute to open-source projects during the month of October.

We care deeply about this initiative — in fact, Keploy started as a small open-source project back in December 2021. During Hacktoberfest 2022, we received over 200 amazing contributions from people around the world, and it helped shape Keploy into what it is today!
