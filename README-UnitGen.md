Keploy-gen uses LLMs to understand code semantics and generates meaningful **unit tests**. It's inspired by the [Automated Unit Test Improvement using LLM at Meta](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09171).

### Objectives

- **Automate unit test generation (UTG)**: Quickly generate comprehensive unit tests and reduce the redundant manual effort.

- **Improve edge cases**: Extend and improve the scope of tests to cover more complex scenarios that are often missed manually.

- **Boost test coverage**: As codebase grows, ensuring exhaustive coverage should become feasible.

## Core Components

| **Phase**                     | **Activities**                                                                                    | **Tools/Technologies**                   |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Code Analysis**             | Analyze the code structure and dependencies.                                                      | Static analysis tools, LLMs              |
| **Prompt Engineering**        | Generation of targeted prompts to guide the LLM in producing relevant tests.                      | LLMs, Custom scripts                     |
| **Iterative Test Refinement** | Cyclic process of refining tests by running them, analyzing coverage, and incorporating feedback. | Testing frameworks (e.g., JUnit, pytest) |

### Process Overview

Referred from [Meta's research](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09171), TestGen-LLM top level architecture.

<img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/keploy.io/meta-llm-process-overview.png" width="90%" alt="Test refinement process of unit test generator"/>

## Prerequisites

**AI model Setup** - Set the environment variable **API_KEY**.
```
export API_KEY=xxxx
```

**API_KEY** can be from either of one these:
- **OpenAI's GPT-4o** directly **[preferred]**.

- Alternative LLMs via [litellm](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-start-proxy---cli).

- Azure OpenAI

## Installation

Install Keploy locally by running the following command:

#### ‚û° Linux/Mac

```shell
 curl --silent -O -L https://keploy.io/install.sh && source install.sh
```

#### ‚û°  Windows

- [Download](https://github.com/keploy/keploy/releases/latest/download/keploy_windows_amd64.tar.gz) and **move the keploy.exe file** to `C:\Windows\System32`

### ![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-6DA55F?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)   ‚û°     Running with Node.js/TypeScript applications

- Ensure you've set the API key, as mentioned in pre-requisites above:

  ```shell
  export API_KEY=xxxx
  ```

- Ensure **Cobertura** formatted coverage reports, edit `jest.config.js` or `package.json`:
  <br/>

  ```json
  // package.json
  "jest": {
        "coverageReporters": ["text", "cobertura"],
      }
  ```
  or  

  ```javascript
    // jest.config.js
    module.exports = {
      coverageReporters: ["text", "cobertura"],
    };
  ```

#### Generating Unit Tests

- Run the following command in the root of your application. 
  <br/>

  - **For Single Test File:** If you prefer to test a smaller section of your application or to control costs, consider generating tests for a single source and its corresponding test file:

    ```shell
     keploy gen --sourceFilePath="<path to source file>" --testFilePath="<path to test file for above source file>" --testCommand="npm test" --coverageReportPath="<path to coverage.xml>"
    ```

    <br/>

  - **For Entire Application** use the following command to generate tests across:

    ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Executing this command will generate unit tests for all files in the application. Depending on the size of the codebase, this process may take between 20 minutes to an hour and will incur costs related to LLM usage.

    ```bash
    keploy gen --testCommand="npm test" --testDir="test" --coverageReportPath="<path to coverage.xml>"
    ```

  üéâ You should see improved test cases and code-coverage. ‚úÖ Enjoy coding with enhanced unit test coverage! ü´∞

### ![Go](https://img.shields.io/badge/go-%2300ADD8.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=go&logoColor=white) ‚Üí Running with Golang applications

- Ensure you've set the API key, as mentioned in pre-requisites above:

  ```shell
  export API_KEY=xxxx
  ```

- To ensure **Cobertura** formatted coverage reports, add:
  ```bash
   go install github.com/axw/gocov/gocov@v1.1.0
   go install github.com/AlekSi/gocov-xml@v1.1.0
  ```
#### Generating Unit Tests
- Run the following command in the root of your application.
  <br/>

  - **For Single Test File:** If you prefer to test a smaller section of your application or to control costs, consider generating tests for a single source and its corresponding test file:

    ```shell
    keploy gen --sourceFilePath="<path to source file>" --testFilePath="<path to test file for above source file>" --testCommand="go test -v ./... -coverprofile=coverage.out && gocov convert coverage.out | gocov-xml > coverage.xml" --coverageReportPath="<path to coverage.xml>"
    ```

    <br/>

  - **For Entire Application** use the following command to generate tests across:

    ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Executing this command will generate unit tests for all files in the application. Depending on the size of the codebase, this process may take between 20 minutes to an hour and will incur costs related to LLM usage.

    ```bash
    keploy gen --testDir="." --testCommand="go test -v ./... -coverprofile=coverage.out && gocov convert coverage.out | gocov-xml > coverage.xml" --coverageReportPath="<path to coverage.xml>"
    ```

    üéâ You should see improved test cases and code-coverage. ‚úÖ Enjoy coding with enhanced unit test coverage! ü´∞

### ‚Üí Setup for Other Languages

- Ensure you've set the API key, as mentioned in pre-requisites above:

  ```shell
  export API_KEY=xxxx
  ```

- Ensure that your unit test report format is **Cobertura**(it's very common).
- Generate tests using keploy-gen:
  ```bash
  keploy gen --sourceFilePath="<path to source code file>" --testFilePath="<path to existing unit test file>" --testCommand="<cmd to execute unit tests>" --coverageReportPath="<path to cobertura-coverage.xml>"
  ```

## Configuration

Configure Keploy using command-line flags:

```bash

  --sourceFilePath ""
  --testFilePath ""
  --coverageReportPath "coverage.xml"
  --testCommand ""
  --coverageFormat "cobertura"
  --expectedCoverage 100
  --maxIterations 5
  --testDir ""
  --llmBaseUrl "https://api.openai.com/v1"
  --model "gpt-4o"
  --llmApiVersion "
```

# Frequently Asked Questions

1. What is Keploy's Unit Test Generator (UTG)? <br>
    - Keploy's UTG automates the creation of unit tests based on code semantics, enhancing test coverage and reliability.

2. Does Keploy send your private data to any cloud server for test generation?<br>
    - No, Keploy does not send any user code to remote systems, except when using the unit test generation feature. When using the UT gen feature, only the source code and the unit test code will be sent to the Large Language Model (LLM) you are using. By default, Keploy uses - litellm to support vast number of LLM backends. Yes, if your organization has its own LLM(a private one), you can use it with Keploy. This ensures that data is not sent to any external systems.

3. How does Keploy contribute to improving unit test   coverage?<br>
    - By providing a zero code platform for automated testing, Keploy empowers developers to scale up their unit test coverage without extensive coding knowledge. This integration enhances testing reports, ultimately boosting confidence in the product's quality.

4. Is Keploy cost-effective for automated unit testing?<br>
   - Yes, Keploy optimizes costs by automating repetitive testing tasks and improving overall test efficiency.

5. How does Keploy generate coverage reports?<br>
    - Keploy generates detailed Cobertura format reports, offering insights into test effectiveness and code quality.

6. Can Keploy handle large codebases efficiently?<br>
   - Yes, Keploy is designed to handle large codebases efficiently, though processing time may vary based on project size and complexity.
