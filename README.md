## About Keploy
[Keploy](https://keploy.io) is a **developer-centric API and integration testing platform** that automatically generates **tests and data mocks** from real user traffic.

It captures API calls, database queries, and external dependencies and replays them deterministically during testing — without requiring any code changes.

## What is Google Summer of Code?
Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a global program designed to bring new contributors into open-source software development.

Open-source organizations participate as mentoring organizations. Contributors submit proposals to work on well-defined projects under the guidance of experienced mentors.

Google provides stipends directly to contributors.  
Since 2024, GSoC has been open to **all open-source newcomers aged 18 and above**, not limited to students.
